## Overview
<hr>
Below is a quick example of a leaflet animation where I incorporate the browser's built-in geolocation as a starting location and using the click event on the map to assign the ending location.  The animation moves the starting marker along a generated street path until it reaches the end location.  The path directions are also displayed in the upper right section of the map.    

**`Future Work`**:  This test case was developed for a potential rideshare and bikeshare analysis that would incorporate an interactive map to visualize vehicle activity and scheduling.
